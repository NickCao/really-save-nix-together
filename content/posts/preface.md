# The open letter to the NixOS foundation (https://save-nix-together.org/) is corrosive to the Nixpkgs project

> **Editor's note**:
> This letter is the work of a number of **not** anonymous contributors.
> I have collected, and hosted, this letter in the hope of giving the growing majority
> of concerned users a venue to better communicate their concerns to the community.
