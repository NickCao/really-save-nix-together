> We believe that the — currently imminent due to burnout by all members — collapse of the moderation team is likely to lead to a further collapse of the core community as a whole by leaving the community spaces entirely unmoderated, which would be taken as a signal of community members needing to leave as well, and that the disempowerment in the Nix culture must be fixed for a functional, empowered, moderation team to exist at all.

The exact thing you are trying to prevent, community members leaving, is what is happening now.

> The timelines that we suggest in this document are not our timelines, they are timelines written with the knowledge of the nearly-empty remaining patience of the people in our community with respect to these issues. Without prompt action by the Foundation, we expect inaction on the present situation to result in substantial amounts of the core maintainership to leave the project as well as many users of marginalized backgrounds.

No, I'm not leaving.
